# Differentiating ADHD from Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

## Overview
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) share several overlapping symptoms, making differential diagnosis challenging. This entry outlines key distinguishing features, assessment strategies, and clinical interpretation of rating scales.

## Overlapping Symptoms
- **Restlessness:** Both conditions can present with physical restlessness or feeling “on edge.”
- **Difficulty Concentrating:** Inattention and distractibility are core features of ADHD; worry and ruminations in GAD can also severely impair focus.
- **Forgetfulness:** Forgetfulness in ADHD is often due to poor working memory and distractibility, whereas in GAD it may result from preoccupation with anxious thoughts.
- **Fatigue:** Mental fatigue can occur in both, though in GAD it is frequently linked to chronic worry and tension.

## Differentiating Features

### **Temporal Onset & Course**
- **ADHD:** Symptoms typically present in childhood (before age 12) and are chronic, though they may be recognized later in life.
- **GAD:** Onset can be at any age, often emerging in adolescence or adulthood, with symptoms waxing and waning in relation to stressors.

### **Nature of Inattention**
- **ADHD:** Distractibility by external stimuli, losing track of tasks, frequent shifts in activity without completion.
- **GAD:** Preoccupation with internal worries, “mind going blank” due to anxiety, difficulty concentrating because of intrusive anxious thoughts.

### **Restlessness / Hyperactivity vs. Anxiety-Driven Agitation**
- **ADHD:** Hyperactivity/impulsivity may be observed as fidgeting, tapping, leaving seat, talking excessively, acting as if “driven by a motor.”
- **GAD:** Restlessness is more often described as feeling tense, keyed up, or unable to relax, without the goal-directed motoric excess seen in ADHD.

### **Emotional Regulation**
- **ADHD:** Emotional lability is common but tends to be brief, reactive, and tied to frustration or boredom.
- **GAD:** Persistent anxiety, excessive worry about multiple domains, and difficulty controlling worry are central.

## Assessment Tools & Interpretation

### **Conners Rating Scales (Conners 3, Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales)**
- **ADHD Profile:** Elevated scores on **Hyperactivity/Impulsivity** and **Inattention** scales; the **ADHD Index** is typically high.
- **GAD Profile:** Elevated scores on the **Emotional Lability** and **Anxiety** subscales; the **Hyperactivity/Impulsivity** scale may be within normal limits or mildly elevated due to restlessness.
- **Key Differentiator:** Compare the relative elevation of **Inattention** vs. **Anxiety** scales. In ADHD, Inattention is disproportionately high; in GAD, Anxiety is the primary elevation.

### **Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)**
- **ADHD Pattern:** Significant elevations on **Inhibit**, **Working Memory**, and **Monitor** scales. **Plan/Organize** may also be elevated.
- **GAD Pattern:** Elevations on **Shift** (difficulty transitioning), **Emotional Control**, and **Self-Monitor** (overly self-critical). **Working Memory** may be mildly affected due to worry.
- **Interpretation Tip:** A profile with high **Shift** and **Emotional Control** alongside normal **Inhibit** suggests GAD rather than ADHD.

### **Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test (IVA)**
- **ADHD:** Deficits in **Vigilance**, **Focus**, and **Speed**; high commission errors (impulsivity) and omission errors (inattention).
- **GAD:** Performance may be variable; errors may increase under time pressure due to anxiety, but the pattern is less consistent than ADHD. **Response Control** may be relatively intact.

## Clinical Interview Strategies

### **Key Questions**
1. “When you have trouble paying attention, is it because your mind is full of worries or because you’re easily sidetracked by things around you?”
2. “Does your restlessness feel more like nervous energy that you can’t shake, or like an internal motor that makes you want to move?”
3. “Do you find yourself avoiding tasks because you’re worried about doing them perfectly, or because you get distracted and start something else?”
4. “When you forget things, is it because you were thinking about something else (anxious thought) or because you didn’t register the information in the first place?”

### **Probing Developmental History**
- Ask about childhood symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and academic struggles.
- Inquire about the presence of worry across the lifespan; GAD often emerges later.

### **Functional Analysis**
- Identify whether impairment is primarily due to distractibility and disorganization (ADHD) or avoidance and procrastination driven by anxiety (GAD).

## Comorbidity Considerations
- High rates of comorbid ADHD and GAD exist; a thorough assessment should evaluate which disorder is primary and whether both are present.
- When both are present, treat the most impairing condition first, but integrated treatment addressing both is often necessary.

## Case Example
**Case A (ADHD):** A 10‑year‑old boy with teacher reports of frequently losing belongings, blurting out answers, and difficulty staying seated. Conners 3 shows T‑scores >70 on Hyperactivity/Impulsivity and Inattention. BRIEF reveals elevated Inhibit and Working Memory.

**Case B (GAD):** A 30‑year‑woman describes constant worry about health, work, and family. She feels tense, fatigued, and has trouble concentrating because “my mind just races.” Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales show elevated Anxiety subscale with normal Hyperactivity/Impulsivity. BRIEF indicates high Shift and Emotional Control.
