# ADHD Differential Diagnosis Guide

A collaborative, peer-reviewed guide for clinicians to differentiate between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and other conditions with overlapping symptoms.

## Purpose

This guide aims to standardize and improve the quality of ADHD assessments by providing clear, evidence-based differentiations between ADHD and other common conditions that present with similar symptoms (e.g., anxiety disorders, trauma-related attentional problems, mood disorders). It is designed as a living reference for graduate students, trainees, and practicing clinicians.

## Structure

- **Entries**: Each entry is a Markdown file located in the `/entries` directory. Each entry focuses on differentiating ADHD from a specific condition or clinical scenario.
- **Proposals**: New entries are proposed via GitHub Issues with the label `proposed-entry`.
- **Review Process**: Drafts are developed in feature branches, reviewed via Pull Requests, and merged after approval.

## How to Contribute

1. **Propose a new entry** by creating an Issue with the title "Entry: Differentiating ADHD from [Condition]" and the label `proposed-entry`.
2. **Draft the entry** by creating a new branch, writing the Markdown file in `/entries`, and opening a Pull Request.
3. **Review and refine** through inline comments and discussions.
